      <h2>My Spirit Animal</h2>
      <p>
        My spirit animal is the <strong>fox</strong>. Like the fox, I am
        adaptable and resourceful, traits that serve me well in the dynamic and
        ever-changing field of software engineering. Foxes are known for their
        cleverness and ability to find innovative solutions to challenges,
        qualities that I bring to my work as a developer. Just as a fox
        navigates its environment with agility and intelligence, I approach
        coding tasks with creativity and strategic thinking.
